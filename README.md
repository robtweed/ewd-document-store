## About ewd-document-store

The *ewd-document-store* module abstracts Global Storage databases as persistent JSON and/or on-disk JavaScript Objects.  It is built upon the lower-level Global Storage access APIs provided by a number of other modules:

- for YottaDB:
  - [mg-dbx](https://github.com/chrisemunt/mg-dbx)
  - [NodeM](https://github.com/dlwicksell/nodem)
- For InterSystems Cache and IRIS:
  - [mg-dbx](https://github.com/chrisemunt/mg-dbx)
  - the *cache.node* and *iris.node* modules that are provided by InterSystems

*ewd-document-store* is the basis of [QEWD-JSdb](https://github.com/robtweed/qewd-jsdb), and provides APIs for a range of database models, including:

- persistent JSON / on-disk JavaScript Objects
- Redis-like Lists
- Redis-like Key/Object store
- Relational Database with SQL
- Persistent XML/HTML DOM with XPath

For more information, see the [QEWD-JSdb documentation](https://github.com/robtweed/qewd-jsdb).


## Installation

    npm install ewd-document-store


## Using ewd-document-store

Most users of *ewd-document-store* will do so through the [*QEWD* framework](https://github.com/robtweed/qewd)
where it is a tightly-integrated piece of QEWD's core functionality. 

It can also be used independently.  If you do so, you will also need to ensure that you are using one of the lower-level Global Storage access modules described above.

It is recommended that you consult the [QEWD-JSdb documentation](https://github.com/robtweed/qewd-jsdb) for more information.


## Integration tests

  * You must have [InterSystem Cach√©](http://www.intersystems.com/our-products/cache/cache-overview/) installed
  * You must have `cache.node` in npm global registy. Read [Installation](http://docs.intersystems.com/latest/csp/docbook/DocBook.UI.Page.cls?KEY=BXJS_intro#BXJS_intro_install) to get more details
  * Run `npm link cache.node` before running integration tests
  * You may need to run this as sudo because of permissions
